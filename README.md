# War-of-Rune

This project aims to increase the tradability of runes and enrich the fun of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Here are some design ideas:

1. People can create their own game worlds similar to engraving runes, akin to launching a "server" in online games. Each "server" can independently set its own artistic resources, determined by the server creator. Resources are specified using ordinals URLs. The name of the first game world is hardcoded as "The Dog King".
2. For simplicity, addresses do not need character creation; the address itself is the character. Therefore, "address" and "character" mean the same thing. Despite this, you can change the image displayed in battles for this address by initiating transactions, similar to changing avatars in X.
3. Characters can battle each other; for simplicity, battles adopt a "Tower of the Sorcerer"-style combat system, meaning characters only have three attributes: health points, attack power, and defense power. To determine who strikes first, we introduce a "speed" attribute. Thus, each character (address) has four attributes: health points, attack power, defense power, and speed.
4. By transferring to addresses with OP_RETURN transactions, you can enhance one of their abilities once per address. The sender can choose from health points, attack power, defense power, or speed.
5. Transactions described in point 4 have a probability (which can be generated by adding the block ID and transaction ID as a seed for randomness) of not only enhancing abilities but also obtaining items. The function of items can be defined in the JSON description of the game world creation script. It can also specify the probability of obtaining items, total quantity of items, etc. Items can be continuous effect type or used in battles, among other types.
6. Items mentioned in point 5 are stored in the UTXO of the transaction. This means you can exchange BTC-items or rune-items using any other runes (or Bitcoin itself).

这里有一些设计思路：

1、人们可以像蚀刻符文一样，开设自己的游戏世界，就像网游的“开服”。各个“服”可以分别设定独立的美术资源，由开服者自己决定。资源以ordinals URL的方式指定。第一个游戏世界的名字我将硬编码为”The Dog King“

2、以简便起见，地址不需要创建角色，地址即角色。以下所说”地址“和”角色“是同一个意思。即便如此，也可以通过发起交易来改变本地址在战斗中显示的图像，就像在X中换头像那样。

3、角色之间可以战斗；同样简便起见，战斗采用《魔塔》式的战斗方式，这意味着角色仅拥有血量、攻击力、防御力3个属性。为了决定第一个出手的人，我们加入“速度“属性。于是每个角色（地址）拥有血量、攻击力、防御力、速度4个属性。

4、通过带有OP_RETURN的交易向地址转账，可以提升一次该地址的某项能力，发起方可以从血量、攻击力、防御力、速度中选择任意一项。

5、第4点中所述的交易有概率（概率可以以区块id和交易id相加作为产生随机数的种子产生）让接收者不仅提升能力，还能获得道具，道具的作用可以在创建游戏世界的时候以脚本代码的方式在description的json中定义，同时在其中还可以定义道具的获得概率、道具总量等等。可以分为持续生效型道具，战斗中使用道具等等。

6、第5点中所说的道具是存储在该转账的utxo里的。也就是说可以用任何其它符文（或者比特币本身）来进行btc-item ，rune-item 交换。
